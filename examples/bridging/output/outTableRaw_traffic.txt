# Nod:   Number of nodes
# NGi:   Number of generated packets per second during interval i
# NRi:   Number of received packets per second during interval i
# Li:    Length in seconds of interval i
# R4/R3: Ratio between received packets in intervals 3 and 4 (measure of network partition)
# R5/R3: Ratio between received packets in intervals 3 and 5 (measure of old/new topologies similarity)
